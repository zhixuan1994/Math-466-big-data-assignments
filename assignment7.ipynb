    "At first, they assume (X,Y) has absolutely continuous distribution with parameter $\\theta$. They also describe some general properties of the Fisher information (FI) in pairs (X,Y), where X is order statistic, and Y represents its concomitant. They also evaluate the FI in Y-concomitant of an X-order statistic and compare its result with the one which generate from a single Y-order statistic. \n",
